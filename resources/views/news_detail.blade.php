        <p>Since 2020, the East River Collaborative has demonstrated that it takes a village—and coordination between
            municipalities, state and federal government, nonprofits and universities—to improve water quality and flood
            resilience at the watershed level.

            “It’s very challenging for municipalities to work across boundaries with other municipalities,” said Julia
            Noordyk, water quality and coastal communities outreach specialist with Wisconsin Sea Grant. Noordyk works
            alongside partners at The Nature Conservancy and NEW Water (the brand of the Green Bay Metropolitan Sewerage
            District) on a core team that provides coordination and technical assistance to communities in the East
            River watershed.

            “Every community is extremely different, and we’re not there to tell them what to do,” said Noordyk.
            Municipalities in the watershed span the rural-urban spectrum and vary in population, budget size and
            capacity.

            “We’re there to listen and to figure out how to help them achieve flood resiliency based on what their
            community’s goals are.”

            The 40-mile-long East River spans three counties in northeastern Wisconsin—Calumet, Manitowoc and Brown—and
            passes through agricultural, suburban and urban landscapes before it meets the Fox River and empties into
            the Bay of Green Bay. Historic flooding in March 2019 resulted in 50 houses being condemned and spurred the
            creation of the East River Collaborative the following year.

            Since that time, the collaborative has worked with communities to identify shared goals across the watershed
            and developed maps and models to visualize flooding impacts. Now, with a new wave of grant funding, the
            collaborative is moving to the next phase: developing an implementation plan to identify and prioritize new
            projects. </p>
